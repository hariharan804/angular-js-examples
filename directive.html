<!-- Explanation -->

<!-- 

1.We define an AngularJS module named directiveApp.
2.We create a custom directive named myDirective using the app.directive() method.
  - The directive restricts usage to elements (restrict: 'E').
  - The template defines the HTML content of the directive.
3.In the HTML, we use the my-directive element to invoke our custom directive.
4.We also define a controller named DirectiveController, although it's not doing anything in this simple example.

<!-- 
Directive restrict:
--------- --------
'E': This restricts the directive to be used only as an element. It means that the directive can only be invoked by declaring an HTML element with the directive's name as the tag name.

'A': This restricts the directive to be used only as an attribute. It means that the directive can only be applied to an existing HTML element as an attribute.

'C': This restricts the directive to be used only as a class. It means that the directive can only be applied to an existing HTML element as a class.

'M': This restricts the directive to be used as a comment. It means that the directive can only be applied to an existing HTML element as a comment.
